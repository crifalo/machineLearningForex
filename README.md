# machineLearningForex
Develop the highest quality and newest machine learning for forex. I currently use scikit entries as they're the easiest. I am trying to get XGB off the ground for <10,000 row datasets. I currently found LGBM best quality for regression outside of XGB. I am interested in feature engineering, and automatic model selectors like Sagemaker, Azure, Linode, Loominus, etc. I prefer Python, but interested in any ML languages that could be more effective such as GO, Scala.
