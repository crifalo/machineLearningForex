# machineLearningForex
Explore the newest and sharpest strategies (ml, prediction, etc) for forex. I currently use scikit entries as they're the easiest (doesn't mean the best). I am trying to get XGB off the ground for <10,000 row datasets. However I am becoming more aware that more rows are better, so why need XGB in that case, at all? For >10,000 rows, LGBM is better vs XGB. I am interested in feature engineering, and automatic model selectors like Sagemaker, Azure, Linode, Loominus, etc. I love learning languages, especially functional languages. However I recognize the useful diversity of multi-paradigm languages. And I hope to master C++.

I analyze eurusd using python and various data science strategies. Using LGBM appears extremely promising. I will be exploring various other prediction and machine learning strategies, which I'll add here later.
