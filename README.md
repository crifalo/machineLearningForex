# machineLearningForex
Develop the highest quality and newest machine learning for forex. I currently use scikit entries as they're the easiest (doesn't mean the best). I am trying to get XGB off the ground for <10,000 row datasets. I currently found LGBM best quality for regression outside of XGB. I am interested in feature engineering, and automatic model selectors like Sagemaker, Azure, Linode, Loominus, etc. I prefer Python, but interested in any ML languages that could be more effective such as GO, Scala.

I predict tomorrow's eurusd price using high-low extrema range and direction by close. Using LGBM the results at present are extremely impressive. And the hlc prediction points are so precise, they allow me to more intuitively and accurately guess the actual form the chart will have during the day, also they provide extremely accurate decision points for actual directional trading. They have allowed me to identify 3 decisive turning points for directional trading within the 24 hour period.
